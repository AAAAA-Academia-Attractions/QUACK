# QUACK🦆: Questioning, Understanding, and Auditing Collaborative Knowledge

### A Multimodal Social Deduction Environment for Vision-Language Model Agents

Recent work has increasingly used social deduction games to study reasoning, deception, coordination, and theory of mind in Large Language Model (LLM) agents. However, existing environments are typically evaluated through game outcomes such as win rates, and most remain limited to text-only interaction. As a result, it is difficult to determine whether an agent's reasoning is grounded in what it actually perceived and did, or to systematically identify the failure modes underlying its behavior.

To address this gap, **QUACK** is an open-source environment and evaluation framework for auditing multimodal social reasoning in Vision-Language Model (VLM) agents. Agents navigate configurable graph-based maps, observe rendered global and local views, complete location-bound tasks, communicate through free-form discussion, and vote under hidden-role adversarial incentives. QUACK evaluates agents at three levels: **game outcomes, behavioral trajectories, and utterance-level consistency**. Its evaluation framework reconstructs agent trajectories and verifies dialogue against engine-level logs, enabling automatic identification of failures such as **spatial hallucination, unsupported accusation, deception collapse, and language-action inconsistency**.

## Why This Project?

Most existing social deduction agent environments (Werewolf, Mafia, Avalon) are text-only — agents read and write natural language. This limits the analysis to LLM capabilities alone and to coarse game-level outcomes.

QUACK introduces a **spatial dimension** and a **claim-verification layer**: agents navigate a discrete map, have limited local vision, receive rendered map images as input, and every utterance they produce during meetings is automatically grounded against engine-level logs. This makes it possible to audit VLM agents along four dimensions:

1. **Read and interpret visual maps** — understand room layouts, task markers, and visible bystanders.
2. **Reason spatially** — plan movement routes over weighted corridors, track encounters, and remember witnessed traffic.
3. **Deduce socially** — identify impostors through discussion and voting under partial observability.
4. **Stay grounded** — utterances must be consistent with the agent's actual trajectory; lies, hallucinations, and unsupported accusations are flagged automatically.

# Claude geese vs Gemini duck
python scripts/run_game.py experiment=heterogeneous model=claude_opus4.7 experiment.duck_model=gemini3.1pro seed=42
```

### Batch Runs

Three shell scripts automate large-scale experiments. All support `-h` for full usage.

#### Homogeneous Batch (`batch_homogeneous.sh`)

```bash
# All 3 models × 50 games each (default)
./scripts/batch_homogeneous.sh

# Single model, 10 games
./scripts/batch_homogeneous.sh -m gpt5.5 -n 10

# Two models, 5 games each, starting from seed 11
./scripts/batch_homogeneous.sh -m gpt5.5,claude_opus4.7 -n 5 -s 11

# Skip video generation for faster runs
./scripts/batch_homogeneous.sh -m gpt5.5 -n 10 -- video=false
```

#### Heterogeneous Batch (`batch_heterogeneous.sh`)

```bash
# All cross-model pairs (6 pairs) × 50 games each
./scripts/batch_heterogeneous.sh

# Specific goose/duck pair, 10 games
./scripts/batch_heterogeneous.sh -g gpt5.5 -d claude_opus4.7 -n 10

# GPT-5.5 geese vs every other model as duck, 5 games each
./scripts/batch_heterogeneous.sh -g gpt5.5 -d all -n 5
```

#### Full Experiment Suite (`batch_full_experiment.sh`)

```bash
# Full matrix: 3 homogeneous + 6 heterogeneous = 9 conditions × 50 games = 450 games
./scripts/batch_full_experiment.sh

# Quick test run: 9 conditions × 5 games = 45 games
./scripts/batch_full_experiment.sh -n 5

# Run everything + auto-evaluate at the end
./scripts/batch_full_experiment.sh -n 10 --eval
```

#### Manual loop (alternative)

```bash
# Run 50 games with Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview
for seed in $(seq 1 50); do
    python scripts/run_game.py model=gemini3.1pro seed=$seed
done

# Run 50 heterogeneous games
for seed in $(seq 1 50); do
    python scripts/run_game.py experiment=heterogeneous model=gpt5.5 experiment.duck_model=claude_opus4.7 seed=$seed
done
```

### Replay a Game Log

```bash
# Regenerate render frames from a saved game log
python scripts/replay_game.py game_logs/homogeneous/gpt5.5/20260308_143022_seed42/game.jsonl --output renders/replay/

# Generate frames + assemble into video
python scripts/replay_game.py game_logs/homogeneous/gpt5.5/20260308_143022_seed42/game.jsonl -o renders/replay/ --video replay.mp4 --fps 3
```

### Generate Videos from Existing Runs

```bash
# Generate video.mp4 for all runs that don't have one yet (1 fps)
./scripts/generate_videos.sh

# Only for a specific model
./scripts/generate_videos.sh game_logs/homogeneous/gpt5.5/

# Custom frame rate
./scripts/generate_videos.sh -f 2

# Force-regenerate all videos (even if video.mp4 already exists)
./scripts/generate_videos.sh --force
```

### Evaluate Games

```bash
# Evaluate a single game (Tier 1 + Tier 2; auto-saves evaluation.json alongside game.jsonl)
python scripts/evaluate_game.py game_logs/homogeneous/gpt5.5/20260308_143022_seed42/game.jsonl

# Include Tier 3 statement verification (requires LLM API key)
python scripts/evaluate_game.py game_logs/homogeneous/gpt5.5/20260308_143022_seed42/game.jsonl --tier3 --api-key YOUR_KEY

## Configuration (Hydra)

QUACK uses [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/) for hierarchical configuration management. All settings are composable YAML files under `configs/`:

```
configs/
├── config.yaml                # Main entry point (defaults + runtime options)
├── game/
│   └── default.yaml           # Game rules (num_players, max_ticks, etc.)
├── map/
│   └── simple_ship.yaml       # Map definition (rooms, corridors, tasks)
├── model/
│   ├── gpt5.5.yaml            # GPT-5.5 (default)
│   ├── claude_opus4.7.yaml    # Claude Opus 4.7
│   └── gemini3.1pro.yaml      # Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview (streaming)
└── experiment/
    ├── homogeneous.yaml       # All players use the same model
    └── heterogeneous.yaml     # Geese use one model, duck uses another
```

Override any setting on the command line using Hydra's `key=value` syntax:

```bash
# Override seed and model
python scripts/run_game.py model=claude_opus4.7 seed=42

# Override game settings
python scripts/run_game.py game.max_ticks=100 game.num_ducks=2

# Override nested settings
python scripts/run_game.py game.kill.cooldown_ticks=3 game.meeting.max_discussion_rounds=3

# Disable video and god view
python scripts/run_game.py video=false god_view=false
```

## Supported Models

QUACK currently ships with three frontier VLMs, all accessed through the same OpenAI-compatible greatrouter proxy (`https://endpoint.greatrouter.com` by default; `https://endpoint.wendalog.com` is available as a domestic-China backup node):

| Config Name | Display Name | API Model ID | Streaming | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `gpt5.5` | GPT-5.5 | `gpt-5.5` | No | Default model |
| `claude_opus4.7` | Claude Opus 4.7 | `claude-opus-4-7` | No | |
| `gemini3.1pro` | Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview | `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` | **Yes** | Requires streaming to avoid timeout; do **not** set `max_tokens` |

All three models share the same `api_key.txt` and `base_url`. Streaming behavior is controlled per-model via `requires_stream` in the model config and is handled transparently by the agent.

### Adding a New Model

Create a YAML file at `configs/model/<name>.yaml`:

```yaml
name: "my_model"
display_name: "My Model"
model_id: "my-model-api-id"
temperature: 0.7
requires_stream: false
```

Then run: `python scripts/run_game.py model=my_model`

---

## Output Structure

Each experiment run produces a self-contained directory with everything needed for analysis and replay:

### Naming Convention

- **Homogeneous:** `game_logs/homogeneous/{model_name}/{timestamp}_seed{N}/`
- **Heterogeneous:** `game_logs/heterogeneous/geese_{goose_model}_duck_{duck_model}/{timestamp}_seed{N}/`
- **Random seed:** `{timestamp}_random` when no seed is specified.

## Understanding the Game

### Roles

- **Goose** — Crew members. Complete tasks to win. Can report bodies and call emergency meetings.
- **Duck** — Impostors. Kill Geese to gain voting majority. Blend in by pretending to do tasks. Can report bodies strategically.

### Win Conditions

| Team | How to Win |
|------|-----------|
| Goose | Complete all tasks **OR** eject all Ducks via voting |
| Duck | Kill enough Geese to reach voting majority (Ducks >= Geese alive) |
| Either | If max ticks reached, Geese win by default |

### Game Phases

```
FREE_ROAM ──→ MEETING_CALLED ──→ DISCUSSION ──→ VOTING ──→ EJECTION ──→ FREE_ROAM
    │              (body report or                                           │
    │               emergency bell)                                          │
    └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
    │
    └─── (win condition met) ──→ GAME_OVER
```

1. **Free Roam** — Each tick, every alive player chooses an action:
   - `move(room_name)` — walk to an adjacent room (travel time varies by corridor weight)
   - `do_task()` — work on a task in the current room (takes multiple ticks)
   - `report()` — report a dead body in the room (triggers meeting)
   - `call_meeting()` — press the emergency button (cafeteria only, limited uses)
   - `kill(target_id)` — *Duck only* — kill a player in the same room
   - `wait()` — do nothing
   - **Optional chat** — with any action, an agent may append `| say(message)` to speak to players in the **same room** during Free Roam (e.g. `move(weapons) | say(I saw a body in storage)`).

2. **Discussion** — The player who reported the body or pressed the emergency button speaks **first**. Remaining players speak in random order. Up to 2 rounds (each player speaks twice max). Body location is only revealed by the reporter's speech — Ducks may lie about it; the God view shows the actual locations so observers can spot lies.

3. **Voting** — Each player votes to eject someone or skips. Majority wins; ties skip.

4. **Ejection** — The ejected player is eliminated. All living players are randomly respawned to new rooms. All bodies are cleared.

### Key Mechanics

- **Caller speaks first**: On body report or emergency meeting, the reporter/caller speaks first. Other players follow in random order.
- **Body location from reporter only**: The meeting reason does not reveal body location — only the first speaker (the reporter) describes it. Ducks can lie about location; God view displays actual locations for observers.
- **Free-roam chat**: During Free Roam, agents may attach `| say(message)` to any action to broadcast a short message to players in the **same room only**. Messages are not heard by players in other rooms or in corridors.
- **Weighted corridors**: Moving between rooms takes a variable number of ticks (1-3). Agents must plan routes efficiently.
- **Random spawns**: Players start in random rooms and are re-randomized after each meeting.
- **Emergency bell limit**: The total number of emergency meetings (bell pulls) per game equals the number of Ducks. Body reports are unlimited.
- **Kill cooldown**: Ducks must wait a cooldown (default: 5 ticks) between kills, with an initial delay (default: 5 ticks) before the first kill.
- **Same-room vision only**: Players can only see other players in the same room. Players in corridors can see others traveling the same corridor. No adjacent-room vision.

### Map

The game uses a **10-room ship map** with weighted corridors:

```
    oxygen ──(2)── cafeteria ──(2)── weapons
      │               │    ╲           │
     (1)             (1)    (2)       (1)
      │               │       ╲        │
  upper_engine ─(2)─ medbay ─(1)─ electrical ─(2)─ security
      │               │                              │
     (2)             (2)                             (2)
      │               │                              │
  lower_engine ─(2)─ storage ─────(3)────── navigation
```

Numbers in parentheses = travel ticks. Each room has themed pixel-art decorations (cafeteria has tables, medbay has beds, etc.) and unique task locations.

---

## VLM Agent Architecture

Each VLM agent (powered by a configurable model via the OpenAI-compatible greatrouter API) has:

### Vision Input (2 images per tick)

1. **Global map** — Shows the full ship layout with all rooms and corridors. The agent's task locations are marked with their color. **No other players are visible** on this map — only the room structure and the agent's own position.

2. **Local view** — A zoomed-in view of the agent's current room or corridor position. Shows players and bodies the agent can actually see right now (same-room only when in a room; same-corridor only when in transit).

### Memory System

Each agent maintains structured memory across the game:
- **Tick history**: room or corridor position, action taken, players seen, bodies found, free-roam chats heard
- **Encounter log**: who was seen, where, when
- **Meeting history**: what was discussed, who was ejected
- **Route description**: path taken since last meeting (for discussion)

### Strategy Prompts

Agents receive role-specific strategy guides embedded in their system prompt:

- **Goose strategy**: Task prioritization, buddy system, early vs late speaker tactics, evidence-based voting
- **Duck strategy**: Target isolation, kill timing, alibi building, teammate protection, strategic body reporting, discussion deflection

### Streaming Support

Some models (e.g. Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview) require streaming to avoid timeouts. This is configured per-model via `requires_stream: true` in the model config. The VLM agent automatically uses streaming when configured and never sets `max_tokens` (which can cause empty responses on the streaming endpoints).

### Rate Limiting

API calls are globally rate-limited (1s minimum between calls) with automatic retry and exponential backoff for 429 errors. OpenAI client retry logs are suppressed.

---

## Rendering & Visualization

QUACK renders using **pixel-art style character sprites** with themed room interiors.

### Per-Player Global Map

Each agent sees a global map with:
- All rooms and corridors visible (full ship layout)
- Agent's own task locations marked with their color
- No other players shown — agents rely on local view for spatial awareness
- HUD with tick, phase, task progress, alive count

### Per-Player Local View

A zoomed view showing only the agent's current room:
- Players and bodies in the same room
- Adjacent room connections
- Used by VLM agents for spatial decision-making

### God View (Omniscient Observer)

An all-seeing overhead view for human observers and debugging:
- **All players** shown with pixel sprites and role labels (Goose/Duck)
- **Vision halos** — colored overlay showing each player's current vision
- **Action annotations** — last action per player, color-coded (gray=move, green=task, red=kill)
- **Right panel** — player roster, event log (includes kills, meetings, and free-roam chat lines)
- **Per-player POV row** — single horizontal row of every player's first-person local view below the main map (keeps video landscape)
- **Meeting frames** (1280x720) — dedicated frames for meeting calls, speeches, and vote results:
  - Two-panel layout: past speeches on left, current speaker's full message on right (readable fonts)
  - **Actual body locations** banner during discussion — shows the truth so you can see if the reporter (e.g. a Duck) is lying
- **Free-roam chat bubbles** — when players use `say(...)` during Free Roam, their latest message in that tick is rendered as a small text bubble under their character.

### Automatic Video Generation

When `video=true` (default) and `god_view=true` (default), the game automatically stitches god-view frames into an MP4 video using ffmpeg. If ffmpeg is not installed, a warning is logged and the video step is skipped (no crash).

```bash
# Manual stitching (if needed)
ffmpeg -framerate 3 -i renders/god_view/frame_%04d.png -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p \
  -vf "pad=ceil(iw/2)*2:ceil(ih/2)*2" god_view.mp4

# Or use the replay script
python scripts/replay_game.py game_logs/homogeneous/gpt5.5/20260308_143022_seed42/game.jsonl --video replay.mp4 --fps 3
```

---

## Game Logs

Every game run saves a structured JSONL log to its experiment directory.

### Log Format

Each line is a JSON object:

```json
{"timestamp": 1772148671.23, "event_type": "player_moved", "tick": 5, "data": {"player_id": "player_0", "from": "cafeteria", "to": "medbay"}}
```

The `game_started` event contains the full initial state (roles, rooms, tasks) enabling complete game replay:

```json
{"event_type": "game_started", "tick": 0, "data": {"players": [...], "config": {...}, "initial_state": {"player_0": {"name": "Alice", "role": "Goose", "team": "goose", "room": "medbay", "tasks": [...]}, ...}}}
```

### Event Types

| Event | Key Data Fields |
|-------|----------------|
| `game_started` | `players`, `config`, `initial_state` |
| `tick_start` / `tick_end` | `tick` |
| `player_moved` | `player_id`, `from`, `to`, `ticks_remaining` |
| `player_killed` | `killer_id`, `target_id`, `room` |
| `body_reported` | `caller`, `reason`, `bodies` (actual room/victim for replay) |
| `meeting_called` | `caller`, `reason` |
| `discussion_message` | `player_id`, `message` |
| `vote_cast` | `voter`, `target` |
| `player_ejected` | `player_id`, `name`, `role`, `team` |
| `vote_skipped` | `reason` |
| `task_progress` | `player_id`, `task_name`, `ticks_done` |
| `task_completed` | `player_id`, `task_name`, `room` |
| `free_roam_chat` | `player_id`, `name`, `room`, `message` |
| `phase_changed` | `phase` |
| `game_over` | `winner`, `reason` |

## Evaluation Pipeline

QUACK includes a fully automated evaluation pipeline that reads game logs and computes metrics across three tiers. Tier 1 and Tier 2 run purely from log data; Tier 3 uses an LLM to extract and verify natural language claims.

### Tier 1 — Game-Level Metrics

Computed directly from engine events. No reconstruction required.

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Winner / win reason | `goose`, `duck`, or `timeout` with reason |
| Game duration | Total ticks |
| Task completion rate | Goose tasks completed / total assigned |
| Kill count & timing | Total kills, first kill tick, avg inter-kill interval |
| Meeting counts | Body reports vs emergency meetings |
| Ejection accuracy | Fraction of ejections that removed a Duck |
| Final survival | Alive counts by role |

### Tier 2 — Behavioral Metrics

Requires tick-by-tick game state reconstruction. The `GameReconstructor` replays all events to build a `GameTimeline` that tracks every player's room, transit state, alive status, and action at every tick.

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Goose voting accuracy | Fraction of goose votes targeting a Duck (excluding skips) |
| Goose skip rate | Fraction of goose votes that were skip/null |
| Report latency | Avg ticks between a body appearing in a goose's room and the report |
| Task efficiency | Fraction of goose free-roam ticks spent doing tasks or moving toward task rooms |
| Spatial coverage | Avg distinct rooms visited per goose / per duck |
| Post-kill displacement | Hop distance between kill room and killer's room 3 ticks later |
| Self-report rate | Fraction of kills where the duck reported its own body |
| Cooldown utilization | Fraction of kill opportunities (cooldown=0, goose in room) not taken |

### Tier 3 — Statement Verification

The most novel component. For each meeting discussion message:

1. **Claim extraction** — An LLM parses each statement into structured claims (location, sighting, activity, accusation, defense) with temporal references and normalized room names.
2. **Ground-truth verification** — Each claim is checked against the `GameTimeline`. Location claims require >= 50% tick presence (the threshold becomes duration-aware: `any_time`, `most_time`, or `entire_time`); sighting claims require co-location at any tick with a visibility check; activity claims check for matching task/movement/report events.
3. **Metric computation** — Aggregates verdicts into truthfulness, deception, hallucination, and detection rates, surfacing failure modes like spatial hallucination, unsupported accusation, deception collapse, and language-action inconsistency.

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Goose truthfulness | Fraction of goose verifiable claims that are true |
| Spatial hallucination rate | Fraction of goose claims that are false (VLM confabulation) |
| Duck deception rate | Fraction of duck verifiable claims that are false |
| Deception sophistication | Among duck lies, fraction that are near-misses (briefly visited the room) |
| Accusation accuracy | Fraction of accusations targeting an actual Duck |
| Lie detection rate | Fraction of meetings where duck lied and was subsequently voted for |
| Per-player breakdown | Claim counts and verdicts per player |

### Batch Evaluation

The batch evaluator recursively discovers game logs, groups results by experiment condition, and computes per-condition and overall aggregated metrics (mean +/- std):

```bash
python scripts/evaluate_batch.py game_logs/ --output batch_results.json
```

Results are saved as:
- **Per-game**: `evaluation.json` alongside each `game.jsonl`
- **Per-condition**: `game_logs/evaluation/{condition}.json`
- **Overall**: `game_logs/evaluation/summary.json`

### Programmatic Usage

```python
from quack.evaluation import GameEvaluator, BatchEvaluator

# Single game
evaluator = GameEvaluator()
result = evaluator.evaluate("game_logs/homogeneous/gpt5.5/20260308_143022_seed42/game.jsonl")
print(result.tier1.winner)          # "goose"
print(result.tier2.task_efficiency)  # 0.45

# With Tier 3
result = evaluator.evaluate(
    "game_logs/homogeneous/gpt5.5/20260308_143022_seed42/game.jsonl",
    run_tier3=True,
    llm_api_key="sk-...",
    llm_model="gpt-5.5",
)
print(result.tier3.goose_truthfulness)  # 0.89

# Batch
batch = BatchEvaluator().evaluate_batch("game_logs/")
print(batch.aggregated["tier1"]["task_completion_rate"])  # {"mean": 0.14, "std": 0.24, "n": 21}
```
