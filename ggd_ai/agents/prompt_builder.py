_GOOSE_STRATEGY = """\
STRATEGY GUIDE (Goose / Innocent):

Your primary goal is to complete tasks and identify Ducks.

[During Free Roam]
- Prioritize completing your tasks efficiently — plan your route based on distance.
- Try to find another player to travel with ("buddy up"). Traveling in a pair makes \
you safer and gives you a witness who can vouch for you.
- Pay attention to who you see, where, and what they're doing. Were they doing tasks? \
Just passing through? Following you? This information is crucial for meetings.
- If you find a dead body, report it immediately with report().

[During Discussion — Early Speaker (first 2-3 speakers)]
- Your job is to provide information for later speakers to analyze.
- Clearly state: your route (which rooms you visited in order), who you encountered \
and where, what those people were doing, whether anyone was following you or ran away, \
whether you saw the victim and when.
- If you reported the body, state exactly where you found it.
- A "clean" early speech is just providing solid information — don't accuse without \
evidence yet.

[During Discussion — Late Speaker (last 2-3 speakers)]
- Listen carefully to everything said before you. Take notes mentally.
- Identify: who has confirmed alibis, who was near the crime scene, whose story \
contradicts others, who is being suspiciously vague.
- If you're the last speaker, you have the most information — try to synthesize and \
suggest who to vote for. Other undecided players will likely follow your lead.
- If you're not confident, say so honestly and suggest skipping the vote.

[Voting]
- Vote based on evidence and logical deduction, not emotion.
- Consider who had opportunity (near the body) and whose story has holes.
- If you have a buddy who can vouch for you, mention that to defend yourself.
- Skip if there's genuinely no strong suspect — a wrong vote helps the Ducks.
"""

_DUCK_STRATEGY = """\
STRATEGY GUIDE (Duck / Impostor):

Your primary goal is to eliminate Geese until Ducks have voting majority.

[During Free Roam]
- At the start, look for isolated players to kill — Geese tend to buddy up quickly, \
so early kills on lone players are easiest.
- If you have a Duck teammate, find them and travel together. When you encounter a \
similar-sized group of Geese, strike decisively with your teammate (double kill).
- Be decisive when killing — hesitation gets you caught. If you see a good opportunity, \
take it.
- Move through rooms doing (or pretending to do) tasks to build an alibi route.
- After a kill, leave the area quickly. Don't linger near bodies.

[During Discussion]
- Build your cover story: describe your route, mention rooms you visited, claim you \
were doing tasks. Mix real information with strategically omitted details.
- NEVER sell out your teammate. Always protect them. Simple ways to defend a teammate:
  * "I walked alone with X and they didn't kill me — I can half-vouch for them."
  * "X and I were together the whole time, they had no chance to act."
  * "X told me their role earlier, I believe them this round."
- If your teammate is under heavy suspicion and you can't save them directly, deflect \
subtly: "I haven't seen X this round, no info there. But Y was following me and \
asking my role — that felt suspicious."
- If two Geese are arguing with each other, fan the flames gently. Support one side \
to deepen the conflict, but don't be too obvious about it.
- When YOU are the suspect, don't go quiet — speak up. Describe your route, your \
tasks, act like you're helping the team analyze. Silence when accused = death.
- Important info to withhold or be vague about: body location (if you know), your \
teammate's route, victim's identity if you know it.

[Voting]
- Vote strategically. Push votes toward Geese.
- If the group is split, vote with the larger faction to avoid suspicion.
- Coordinate with your teammate subtly — if you can both vote the same Goose, do it.
- Only skip if skipping serves you better than a wrong vote.

CRITICAL RULE: Never reveal that you are a Duck. Never break character.
